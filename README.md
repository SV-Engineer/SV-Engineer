# Elevator Speech
My name is Austin. I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from University of Florida; co 2020. On the professional side of things, I am a Digital Design Engineer and I love to tinker and learn new concepts. An example of this is that I have recently discovered the composition approach in object oriented programming. This is similar to the traditional inheritance approach, yet it has it's own nuances. My current understanding of the main benefit of the composition approach is that alike data may be stored in contiguous memory, meaning that iterating through said data is more efficient because the CPU is enabled to fetch the data it needs (and only the data it needs). Furthermore, there is also a resultant reduction in branches, preventing the pipeline from being cleared. This directly implies that the branch prediction implemented in the pipeline is more meaningful. As less branching is done overall, there is less opportunity for a "miss." It is the act of learning that keeps me motivated and this kind of knowledge is what helps drive that behavior. Lastly, it's worth noting that I cannot claim to know everything. Thus, I find myself constantly adjusting my views, in hopes that I may keep them aligned with what is correct; as opposed to being correct. I wish to surround myself with like minded people where ever I go.
