# Elevator Speech
My name is Austin. I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from University of Florida; co 2020. On the professional side of things, I am a Digital Design Engineer that also performs Lead Embedded Engineer tasks. I love to tinker and learn new concepts. It is the act of learning that keeps me motivated. I cannot claim to know everything. I find myself constantly adjusting my views, in hopes that I may keep them aligned with what is correct. As opposed to being correct. I wish to surround myself with like minded people where ever I go.
