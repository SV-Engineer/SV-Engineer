## Notes:
1. If you have found this page and are wondering why all of the repositories seem so sparse, I do have an answer. The answer is that I previously had a repository associated with my university email. That email has been deleted. For one, I didn't anticipate that git would lock me out and for two I truthfully did neglect it to some extent. One part of me wants to try and recover it and the other takes this as an opportunity to consolidate and rewrite. I cannot truthfully say I understood, let alone followed, good coding practices in university. The only code I believe worth recovering from that period includes:
  *  My independent implementation of an RTOS on an ARM M4 uProcessor (C).
  *  My implementation of a MIPS 32-bit processor including pipelining, data forwarding and hazard detection (VHDL).
  *  My various machine learning algorithms implemented in python with pytorch.

2. Some of the above mentioned were whole courses worth of work. Even if I did reproduce the code, some of it would likely have to remain private. Most importantly out of respect for the professors that enabled me to learn and secondarily because of enabling current students to violate the plagiarism code of conduct standards.

## Coding Languages
* Embedded C
* Some ARM Assembly
* Python
* System Verilog

# Elevator Speech
My name is Austin. I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from University of Florida; co 2020. On the professional side of things, I am a Digital Design Engineer and I love to tinker and learn new concepts. An example of this is that I have recently discovered the composition approach in object oriented programming. This is similar to the traditional inheritance approach, yet it has it's own nuances. My current understanding of the main benefit of the composition approach is that alike data may be stored in contiguous memory, meaning that iterating through said data is more efficient because the CPU is enabled to fetch the data it needs (and only the data it needs). Furthermore, there is also a resultant reduction in branches, preventing the pipeline from being cleared. This directly implies that the branch prediction implemented in the pipeline is more meaningful. As less branching is done overall, there is less opportunity for a "miss." It is the act of learning that keeps me motivated and this kind of knowledge is what helps drive that behavior. Lastly, it's worth noting that I cannot claim to know everything. Thus, I find myself constantly adjusting my views, in hopes that I may keep them aligned with what is correct; as opposed to being correct. I wish to surround myself with like minded people where ever I go.

# About
In general I consider myself a reasonably simple person. I enjoy interacting with my wife, our cats, and our friends. As far as hobbies go, I enjoy compelling stories, tinkering with things to discover what makes them work, and laughing at the various absurdities that present themselves to me in life. I cannot claim to have life sorted out. I can claim to realize that I am here and I want to make an impact; preferably in a way that guides us all in a positive way. 

My heroes include:
  * Nikola Tesla in his tireless endeavors to improve.
  * Cecilia Payne in her stalwart efforts in the face of adversity to convince the rest of the world that really, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.
  * Albert Einstein in his pure force of will to consider all wrong possibilities until he got to the correct answer.
  * Christopher Hitchens in his endeavor to encourage people to think critically and his sincere compassion for others.
  * Neil Degrasse-Tyson and Bill Nye both in their patience as they try to educate as many people as they can.

I originally set out to "change the world" in whatever way I could manifest after reading Nikola Tesla's autobiography [My Inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Inventions:_The_Autobiography_of_Nikola_Tesla). What that book meant to me was that even if we are struggling with, whatever it may be, we can still achieve. From there I went forward into the adventure of college. A fool with an open mind. In school, high school and before, I truly can claim the title of uneducated fool. I knew very little while being immensely adversarial. The hall-mark of a true fool. I took the math aptitude test, and tested at the lowest level offered at the community college; Intermediate Algebra. I knew how to add and subtract and multiply, though division I required a calculator. To be honest, I still don't know my times tables and I have to look up how long division works everytime it becomes necessary (looking at you partial fraction decomposition). Yet despite all of this, at some point or other, I demonstrated competency in Vector Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics, Circuit Analysis, and so much more.
